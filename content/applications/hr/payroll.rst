=======
Payroll
=======

Odoo *Payroll* is used to process work entries and create payslips for employees. Payroll works in
conjunction with other Odoo apps, such as *Employees*, *Time Off*, *Attendances*, and *Planning*.

The Payroll app helps ensure there are no issues or conflicts when validating work entries, handles
country-specific localizations to ensure that payslips follow local rules and taxes, and allows for
salary assignments. Payroll configuration is critical to ensure accurate and timely processing of
payslips.

Settings
========

To access the *Settings*, go to :menuselection:`Payroll --> Configuration --> Settings`. The various
settings for accounting, localizations, time off, alerts, and payslip settings are specified here.

Accounting
----------

The accounting section of the configuration menu relates to three options:

- :guilabel:`Payroll Entries`: enable this option to post payroll slips in accounting.
- :guilabel:`Payroll SEPA`: enable this option to create SEPA payments.
- :guilabel:`Batch Account Move Lines`: enable this option to have a single account move line
  created from all the accounting entries from the same period. This disables the generation of
  single payments.

Localizations
-------------

*Localizations* are country-specific settings pre-configured in Odoo at the creation of the
database, and account for all taxes, fees, and allowances for that particular country. The
:guilabel:`Localization` section of the :guilabel:`Settings` may include specific settings that need
to be set for the specific locality, and a detailed view of all benefits provided to employees. What
is shown in this section varies depending on the localization enabled for the database.

Any country-specific localizations are set up in the :guilabel:`Localization` section of the
:guilabel:`Settings` screen. All localization items are pre-populated when the country is specified
during the creation of the database. It is not recommended to alter the localization settings unless
specifically required.

.. note::
   Odoo can handle a multi-company configuration. This is generally done when there is a main
   company or office location, such as a headquarters, and there are other offices/branches around
   the country or globe, that fall under that main company or headquarters. In Odoo, each company,
   including the headquarters, would be setup as their own company/branch using the multi-company
   method.

   Each individual company can have a different localization setting configured for that specific
   company, since company locations can vary and be located anywhere in the world, where rules and
   laws differ. For more information on companies refer to the :doc:`Companies
   <../general/users/companies>` documentation on setting up companies.

Time off
--------

- :guilabel:`Deferred Time Off`: if time off is taken after payslips are validated, the time off
  needs to be applied ot the following pay period. Select the person responsible for validating
  these specific time off situations using the drop-down menu in the :guilabel:`Responsible` field.

.. example::
   An employee is paid on the 15th of the month and the last day of the month. Payslips are
   typically processed a day before. If an employee's payslip is approved and processed on the 30th,
   but takes an unexpected sick day on the 31st, the time off needs to be logged. Since the employee
   is already paid for a regular work day on the 31st, in order to keep the time off balances
   correct, the sick day is moved/applied to the 1st of the next month (the next pay period).

Payroll
-------

- :guilabel:`Contract Expiration Notice Period`: enter the number of :guilabel:`Days` before a
  contract expires that the responsible person is notified.
- :guilabel:`Work Permit Expiration Notice Period`: enter the number of :guilabel:`Days` before a
  work permit expires that the responsible person is notified.
- :guilabel:`Payslip PDF Display`: enable this option to have payslips display a PDF file on the
  payslip form.

.. _payroll/work-entries-config:

Contracts
=========

In order for an employee to be paid, they must have an active contract for a specific type of
employment. Creating and viewing contract templates, and creating and viewing employment types is
possible form this section of the configuration menu.

Templates
---------

Contract templates are used with the *Recruitment* application when sending an offer to a candidate.
The contract template forms the basis of an offer, and can be modified for specific candidates or
employees when necessary. If a contract template is create dor modified in the *Payroll*
application, the changes are also reflected in the *Recruitment* application.

To view all the current contract templates in the database, navigate to :menuselection:`Payroll
application --> Configuration --> Contracts: Templates`. All current contract templates appear in a
list view. To view the details of a contract template, click anywhere on the line to open the
contract form. The contract template can be modified from this form. Make ay desired changes to the
contract.

To create a new contract template, click the :guilabel:`New` button. Enter the following information
on the form:

- :guilabel:`Contract Reference`: enter a description for the template. This should be clear and
  easily understood as this name will appear in the *Recruitment* application as well.
- :guilabel:`Working Schedule`: select the desired working schedule the contract applies to form the
  drop-down menu. If a new working schedule is needed, create a :ref:`new working schedule
  <payroll/new-working-schedule>`.
- :guilabel:`Work Entry Source`: select how the work entries are generated. Choices are either:

  - :guilabel:`Working Schedule`: work entries are generated based on the selected working schedule.
  - :guilabel:`Attendances`: work entries are generated based on the employee's attendance as they
    are logged in the *Attendances* application. Refer to the :ref:`Attendances
    <attendances/check-in>` document for information on checking in and out.
  - :guilabel:`Planning`: work entries are generated based on the employee's panning in the
    *Planning* application.

- :guilabel:`Salary Structure Type`: select the :ref:`salary structure type
  <payroll/structure-types>` from the drop-down menu.
- :guilabel:`Department`: select the department the contract template applies to from the drop-down
  menu. If blank, the template applies to all departments.
- :guilabel:`Job Position`: select the :ref:`job position <payroll/job-positions>` the contract
  template applies to from the drop-down menu. If blank, the template applies to all job positions.
- :guilabel:`Wage on Payroll`: enter the monthly wage in the field.
- :guilabel:`Contract Type`: select the type of contract from the drop-down menu. This list is the
  same as the :ref:`Employment Types <payroll/employment-types>`.
- :guilabel:`HR Responsible`: select the employee who is responsible for validating contracts using
  this template from the drop-down menu.
- :guilabel:`New Contract Document Template`: select a default document that a new employee has to
  sign in order to accept an offer.
- :guilabel:`Contract Update Document Template`: select a default document that a current employee
  has to sign in order to update their contract.

Salary information tab
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- :guilabel:`Wage Type`: select either :guilabel:`Fixed Wage` or :guilabel:`Hourly` from the
  drop-down menu.
- :guilabel:`Schedule Pay`: using the drop-down menu, select how often the employee is paid. Options
  include :guilabel:`Annually`, :guilabel:`Semi-annually`, :guilabel:`Quarterly`,
  :guilabel:`Bi-monthly`, :guilabel:`Monthly`, :guilabel:`Semi-monthly`, :guilabel:`Bi-weekly`,
  :guilabel:`Weekly`, or :guilabel:`Daily`.
- :guilabel:`Wage`: enter the gross wage. The time period presented is based on what is selected for
  the :guilabel:`Scheduled Pay` field. It is recommended to populate the :guilabel:`Yearly Cost
  (Real)` field first, since that entry updates this field automatically.
- :guilabel:`Yearly Cost (Real)`: enter the total yearly cost the employee costs the employer. When
  this value is entered, the :guilabel:`Monthly Cost (Real)` is automatically updated.
- :guilabel:`Monthly Cost (Real)`: this field is not able to be edited. The value is automatically
  populated after the :guilabel:`Yearly Cost (Real)` is entered.

.. important::
    The :guilabel:`Schedule Pay`, :guilabel:`Wage`, and :guilabel:`Yearly Cost (Real)` fields are
    all linked. If any of these fields is updated, the other two fields automatically update to
    reflect what was changed. It is best practice to check these three fields if any modifications
    have been made, to ensure they are accurate.

.. image:: payroll/salary-info.png

Pre-tax benefits and post-tax deductions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Depending on the localization settings set for the company, the entries presented in this section
will either vary, or may not appear at all. For example, some entires may pertain to retirement
accounts, health insurance benefits, and commuter benefits. Enter any information requested in this
section.

.. _payroll/employment-types:

Employment types
----------------

To view all the pre-configured employment types, navigate to :menuselection:`Payroll application -->
Configuration --> Contracts: Employment Types`. The employment types are presented in a list view.
The default employment types are :guilabel:`Permanent`, :guilabel:`Temporary`, :guilabel:`Seasonal`,
:guilabel:`Interim`, :guilabel:`Full-Time`, :guilabel:`Part-Time`, and :guilabel:`Permanent`.

To make a new employment type, click the :guilabel:`New` button and a blank line appears at the
bottom of the form. Enter the nae of the employment type in the field. If the employment type is
country-specific, select the country using the drop-down menu. If a country is selected, then the
employment type is only applicable for that specific country.

To rearrange the order of the employment types, click on the six small gray boxes to the left of the
employment tye name, and drag the line to the desired position.

Work entries
============

A *work entry* is an individual record on an employee's timesheet. Work entries can be configured to
account for all types of work and time off, such as :guilabel:`Attendance`, :guilabel:`Sick Time
Off`, :guilabel:`Training`, or :guilabel:`Public Holiday`.

.. seealso::
   :doc:`Manage work entries <payroll/work_entries>`

Work entry types
----------------

When creating a work entry in the *Payroll* application, or when an employee enters information in
the *Timesheets* application, a :guilabel:`Work Entry Type` needs to be selected. The list of
:guilabel:`Work Entry Types` is automatically created based on localization settings set in the
database.

To view the current work entry types available, go to :menuselection:`Payroll --> Configuration -->
Work Entries --> Work Entry Types`.

Each work entry type has a code to aid in the creation of payslips, and to ensure all taxes and fees
are correctly entered.

.. image:: payroll/work-entry-types.png
   :align: center
   :alt: List of all work entry types currently available for use, with the payroll code and color.

New work entry type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a new :guilabel:`Work Entry Type`, click the :guilabel:`New` button, and enter the
information for the following sections on the form.

General information section
***************************

- :guilabel:`Work Entry Type Name`: the name should be short and descriptive, such as `Sick Time` or
  `Public Holiday`.
- :guilabel:`Payroll Code`: this code appears with the work entry type on timesheets and payslips.
  Since the code is used in conjunction with the *Accounting* application, it is advised to check
  with the accounting department for a code to use.
- :guilabel:`DMFA code`: this code is used to identify :abbr:`DMFA (De Multifunctionele Aangifte)`
  entries on a corresponding DMFA report. The DMFA report is a quarterly report that Belgian-based
  companies are required to submit for social security reporting purposes. This report states the
  work done by the employees during the quarter, as well as the salaries paid to those employees.
- :guilabel:`External Code`: this code is used for exporting data to a third-party payroll service.
  Check with the third-party being used in order to determine the :guilabel:`External Code` to enter
  for the new work entry type.
- :guilabel:`SDWorx code`: this code is only for companies that use SDWorx, a payroll service
  provider.
- :guilabel:`Color`: select a color for the particular work entry type.

Display in payslip section
**************************

- :guilabel:`Rounding`: The rounding method selected determines how quantities on timesheet entries
  are displayed on the payslip.

  - :guilabel:`No Rounding`: A timesheet entry is not modified.
  - :guilabel:`Half Day`: A timesheet entry is rounded to the closest half day amount.
  - :guilabel:`Day`: A timesheet entry is rounded to the closest full day amount.

.. example::
   If the working time is set to an 8-hour work day (40-hour work week), and an employee enters a
   time of 5.5 hours on a timesheet, and :guilabel:`Rounding` is set to :guilabel:`No Rounding`, the
   entry remains 5.5 hours. If :guilabel:`Rounding` is set to :guilabel:`Half Day`, the entry is
   changed to 4 hours. If it is set to :guilabel:`Day`, it is changed to 8 hours.

Unpaid section
**************

- :guilabel:`Unpaid in Structures Types`: If the work entry is for work that is not paid, specify
  which pay structure the unpaid work entry applies to from the drop-down menu. Some situations
  where work would be logged on a timesheet but no compensation given would be for unpaid
  internships, unpaid training, or volunteer work.

Valid for advantages section
****************************

- :guilabel:`Meal Voucher`: if the work entry should count towards a meal voucher, check the box.
- :guilabel:`Representation Fees`: if the work entry should count towards representation fees, check
  the box.
- :guilabel:`Private Car Reimbursement`: if the work entry should count towards a private car
  reimbursement, check the box.

Time off options section
************************

- :guilabel:`Time Off`: check this box if the work entry type can be selected for a time off request
  or entry in the *Time Off* application. If :guilabel:`Time Off` is checked, a :guilabel:`Time Off
  Type` field appears. This field has a drop-down menu to select the specific type of time off, such
  as `Paid Time Off`, `Sick Time Off`, or `Extra Hours` for example. A new type of time off can be
  entered in the field if the listed types of time off in the drop-down menu do not display the type
  of time off needed.
- :guilabel:`Keep Time Off Right`: this is for Belgian-specific companies only, and will not appear
  for other localizations. Check this box if the work entry is for time off that will affect the
  time off benefits for the following year. Workers are given time off each year according to the
  government, and in some cases, time-off taken during a specific time period can affect how much
  time off the employee will receive or accrue the following year.

Reporting section
*****************

- :guilabel:`Unforeseen Absence`: if the work entry should be visible on the unforeseen absences
  report, check this box.

.. image:: payroll/new-work-entry.png

Working schedules
-----------------

To view the currently configured working schedules, go to :menuselection:`Payroll --> Configuration
--> Work Entries --> Working Schedules`. The working schedules that are available for an employee's
contracts and work entries are found in this list.

Working schedules are company-specific. Each company must identify each type of working schedule
they use. If the database is created for only one company, the company column is not available.

.. Example::
   An Odoo database containing multiple companies that use a standard 40-hour work week needs to
   have a separate working schedule entry for each company that uses the 40-hour standard work week.

   A database with five companies that all use a standard 40-hour work week needs to have five
   separate 40-hour working schedules configured.

.. image:: payroll/working-schedules.png
   :align: center
   :alt: All working schedules available to use currently set up in the database for the company.

.. _payroll/new-working-schedule:

New working schedule
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a new working schedule, click the :guilabel:`New` button, and enter the information on the
form.

The fields are auto-populated for a regular 40-hour work week but can be modified. First, change the
name of the working time by modifying the text in the :guilabel:`Name` field. Next, make any
adjustments to the days and times that apply to the new working time.

In the :guilabel:`Working Hours` tab, modify the :guilabel:`Day of Week`, :guilabel:`Day Period`,
and :guilabel:`Work Entry Type` selections by clicking on the drop-down menus in each column and
making the desired selection. The :guilabel:`Work From` and :guilabel:`Work To` columns are modified
by typing in the time.

.. note::
   The :guilabel:`Work From` and :guilabel:`Work To` times must be in a 24-hour format. For example,
   `2:00 PM` would be entered as `14:00`.

If the working time should be in a two-week configuration, click the :guilabel:`Switch to 2 weeks
calendar` button in the top left. This creates entries for an :guilabel:`Even week` and an
:guilabel:`Odd week`.

Salary
======

.. _payroll/structure-types:

Structure types
---------------

In Odoo, an employee's payslip is based on *structures* and *structure types*, which both affect how
an employee enters timesheets. Each structure type is an individual set of rules for processing a
timesheet entry, which consists of different structures nested within it. Structure types define how
often an employee gets paid, the working hours, and if wages are based on a salary (fixed) or how
many hours the employee worked (varied).

For example, a structure type could be `Employee`, and that structure type could have two different
structures in it: a `Regular Pay` structure which includes all the separate rules for processing
regular pay, as well as a structure for an `End of Year Bonus` which includes the rules only for the
end of year bonus. Both the `Regular Pay` structure and `End of Year Bonus` structure are structures
within the `Employee` structure type.

The different structure types can be seen by going to :menuselection:`Payroll --> Configuration -->
Salary --> Structure Types`.

There are two default structure types configured in Odoo: *Employee* and *Worker*. Typically,
*Employee* is used for salaried employees, which is why the wage type is *Monthly Fixed Wage*, and
*Worker* is typically used for employees paid by the hour, so the wage type is *Hourly Wage*.

.. image:: payroll/structure-type.png
   :align: center
   :alt: List of all currently configured structure types available to use.

New structure type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To make a new structure type, click the :guilabel:`New` button and a structure type form appears.
Enter the information in the fields. Most fields are pre-populated, but all the fields can be
modified.

- :guilabel:`Structure Type`: enter the name for the new structure type, such as `Employee` or
  `Worker`.
- :guilabel:`Country`: select the country that the new structure type applies to from the drop-down
  menu.
- :guilabel:`Wage Type`: select what type of wage the new structure type will use, either
  :guilabel:`Fixed Wage` or :guilabel:`Hourly Wage`. If the wage type is going to be used for
  salaried employees who receive the same wage every pay period, select :guilabel:`Fixed Wage`. If
  the wage type is going to be used for employees who receive wages based on how many hours they
  worked during a pay period, select :guilabel:`Hourly Wage`.
- :guilabel:`Default Scheduled Pay`: select the typical pay schedule for the new structure type from
  the drop-down menu. Options are :guilabel:`Monthly`, :guilabel:`Quarterly`,
  :guilabel:`Semi-annually`, :guilabel:`Annually`, :guilabel:`Weekly`, :guilabel:`Bi-weekly`,
  :guilabel:`Bi-monthly`. This indicates how often this specific type of structure is paid out.
- :guilabel:`Default Working Hours`: select the default working hours for the new structure type
  from the drop-down menu. All available working hours for the currently selected company appear in
  the drop-down menu. The default working hours that are pre-configured in Odoo is the
  :guilabel:`Standard 40 hours/week` option. If the needed working hours do not appear in the list,
  a :ref:`new set of default working hours can be created <new-default-working-hours>`.
- :guilabel:`Regular Pay Structure`: type in the name for the regular pay structure.
- :guilabel:`Default Work Entry Type`: select the default type of work entry the new structure type
  will fall under from the drop-down menu. Options include :guilabel:`Attendance`,
  :guilabel:`Overtime Hours`, :guilabel:`Generic Time Off`, :guilabel:`Compensatory Time Off`,
  :guilabel:`Home Working`, :guilabel:`Unpaid`, :guilabel:`Sick Time Off`, :guilabel:`Paid Time
  Off`, :guilabel:`Out Of Contract`, :guilabel:`Extra Hours`, and :guilabel:`Long Term Time Off`.

.. image:: payroll/new-structure.png
   :align: center
   :alt: New structure type form to fill out when creating a new structure type.

.. _new-default-working-hours:

New default working hours
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To make new default working hours, type the name for the new working hours in the :guilabel:`Default
Working Hours` field on the new structure type form. Click :guilabel:`Create and edit`. A default
working hours form will pop up. The default working hours form has two sections, a general
information section and a tab listing out all the individual working hours by day and time. When the
form is completed, click :guilabel:`Save & Close`.

- :guilabel:`Name`: type in the name for the new default working hours. This should be descriptive
  and clear to understand, such as `Standard 20 Hours/Week`.
- :guilabel:`Company`: select the company that can use these new default working hours from the
  drop-down menu. Keep in mind, working hours are company-specific and cannot be shard between
  companies. Each company needs to have their own working hours set.
- :guilabel:`Average Hour Per Day`: the average hours per day field will be auto-populated based on
  the working hours configured in the *Working Hours* tab. This entry affects resource planning,
  since the average daily hours affect what resources can be used, and in what quantity, per work
  day.
- :guilabel:`Timezone`: select the timezone that the new default working hours will be used for from
  the drop-down menu.
- :guilabel:`Company Full Time`: enter the number of hours per week an employee would need to work
  in order to be considered a full-time employee. Typically, this is approximately 40 hours, and
  this number affects what types of benefits an employee can receive based on their employment
  status (full-time vs part-time).
- :guilabel:`Work Time rate`: this percentage is auto-generated based on the entry for the
  :guilabel:`Company Full Time` and the working hours configured in the *Working Hours* tab. This
  number should be between `0.00%` and `100%`, so if the percentage is above `100%`, it is an
  indication that the working times and/or :guilabel:`Company Full Time` hours need adjustment.
- :guilabel:`Working Hours` Tab: this tab is where each day's specific working hours are listed.
  When a new default working hour form is created, the working hours tab is pre-populated with a
  default 40-hour week, with each day divided into three timed sections. Every day has morning
  (8:00-12:00), lunch (12:00-13:00), and evening (13:00-17:00) hours configured using a 24 hour time
  format. To adjust any of these hours, click on the specific field to adjust, and make the
  adjustment using the drop-down menus, or in the specific case of the times, type in the desired
  time.

  .. note::
     If the working hours are not consistent each week, and the hours are on a bi-weekly schedule
     instead, click the :guilabel:`Switch to 2 week calendar` button at the top of the new default
     working hours form. This will change the working hours tab to display two weeks of working
     times that can be adjusted.

Structures
----------

*Salary structures* are the different ways an employee gets paid within a specific *structure*, and
are specifically defined by various rules.

The amount of structures a company needs for each structure type depends on how many different ways
employees are paid, and how their pay is calculated. For example, a common structure that could be
useful to add may be a `Bonus`.

To view all the various structures for each structure type, go to :menuselection:`Payroll -->
Configuration --> Salary --> Structures`.

Each :ref:`structure type <payroll/structure-types>` lists the various structures associated with
it. Each structure contains a set of rules that define it.

.. image:: payroll/salary-structure.png
   :align: center
   :alt: All available salary structures.

Click on a structure to view its :guilabel:`Salary Rules`. These rules are what calculate the
payslip for the employee.

.. image:: payroll/structure-regular-pay-rules.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Salary structure details for Regular Pay, listing all the specific Salary Rules.

Rules
-----

Each structure has a set of *salary rules* to follow for accounting purposes. These rules are
configured by the localization, and affect actions in the *Accounting* application, so modifications
to the default rules, or the creation of new rules, should only be done when necessary.

To view all the rules, go to :menuselection:`Payroll app --> Configuration --> Salary --> Rules`.
Click on a structure (such as :guilabel:`Regular Pay`) to view all the rules.

To make a new rule, click :guilabel:`New`. A new rule form appears. Enter the information in the
fields.

The required fields for a rule are:

- :guilabel:`Name`: enter a name for the rule.
- :guilabel:`Category`: select a category the rule applies to from the drop-down menu, or enter a
  new one.
- :guilabel:`Code`: enter a code to be used for this new rule. It is recommended to coordinate with
  the accounting department for a code to use as this will affect accounting reports and payroll
  processing.
- :guilabel:`Salary Structure`: select a salary structure the rule applies to from the drop-down
  menu, or enter a new one.
- :guilabel:`Condition Based on`: in the :guilabel:`General` tab, select from the drop-down menu
  whether the rule is :guilabel:`Always True` (always applies), a :guilabel:`Range` (applies to a
  specific range, which is entered beneath the selection), or a :guilabel:`Python Expression` (the
  code is entered beneath the selection).
- :guilabel:`Amount Type`: in the :guilabel:`General` tab, select from the drop-down menu whether
  the amount is a :guilabel:`Fixed Amount`, a :guilabel:`Percentage (%)`, or a :guilabel:`Python
  Code`. Depending on what is selected, the fixed amount, percentage, or Python code needs to be
  entered next.

.. image:: payroll/new-rule.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Enter the information for the new rule on the new rule form.

Rule parameters
---------------

.. note::
   Currently, the :guilabel:`Rule Parameters` feature found inside the :menuselection:`Payroll app
   --> Configuration --> Salary --> Rule Parameters` menu is still in development and only serves a
   specific use case for Belgian markets. The documentation will be updated when this section has
   matured to more markets.

Other input types
-----------------

When creating payslips, it is sometimes necessary to add other entries for specific circumstances,
like expenses, reimbursements, or deductions. These other inputs can be configured by going to
:menuselection:`Payroll --> Configuration --> Salary --> Other Input Types`.

.. image:: payroll/other-input.png
   :align: center
   :alt: A list of other input types for payroll that can be selected when creating a new entry for
         a payslip.

To create a new input type, click the :guilabel:`New` button. Enter the :guilabel:`Description`, the
:guilabel:`Code`, and which structure it applies to in the :guilabel:`Availability in Structure`
field.

.. important::
   The :guilabel:`Code` is used in the salary rules to compute payslips. If the
   :guilabel:`Availability in Structure` field is left blank, it indicates that the new input type
   is available for all payslips and is not exclusive to a specific structure.

.. image:: payroll/input-type-new.png
   :align: center
   :alt: A new Input Type form filled in..

Salary attachment types
-----------------------

Salary attachments, also thought of as wage garnishments, are portions of earnings taken out of a
payslip for something specific. Much like all other aspects of payroll configurations, the types of
salary attachments need to be defined.

To view the currently configured salary attachments, navigate to :menuselection:`Payroll -->
Configuration --> Salary --> Salary Attachment Types`. The default salary attachment types are
:guilabel:`Attachment of Salary`, :guilabel:`Assignment of Salary`, and :guilabel:`Child Support`.

To make a new type of salary attachment, click the :guilabel:`New` button. Enter the
:guilabel:`Description` and the :guilabel:`Code` (used in the salary rules to compute payslips).

.. image:: payroll/new-attachment.png
   :align: center
   :alt: A new salary attachment form filled in.

Salary package configurator
===========================

The various options under the :guilabel:`Salary Package Configurator` section of the
:menuselection:`Payroll --> Configuration --> Salary Package Configurator` menu all affect an
employee's potential salary. These sections (:guilabel:`Benefits`, :guilabel:`Personal Info`,
and :guilabel:`Resume`) specify what benefits can be offered to an employee in their salary package.

Depending on what information an employee enters (such as deductions, dependents, etc.), their
salary is adjusted accordingly. When an applicant applies for a job on the company website, the
sections under :guilabel:`Salary Package Configurator` directly affect what the applicant sees, and
what is populated as the applicant enters information.

Benefits
--------

When offering potential employees a position, there can be certain benefits set in Odoo in addition
to the salary to make an offer more appealing (such as extra time off, the use of a company car,
reimbursement for a phone or internet, etc.).

To view the benefits, go to :menuselection:`Payroll --> Configuration --> Salary Package
Configurator: Benefits`. Benefits are grouped by :guilabel:`Structure type`, and the benefit listed
for a particular structure type is only available for that specific structure.

.. image:: payroll/benefits.png
   :align: center
   :alt: A list view of all the benefits available for each structure type.

.. example::
   A company has two structure types, one labeled :guilabel:`Employee`, and anther labeled
   :guilabel:`Intern`. The :guilabel:`Employee` structure type contains an advantage of using a
   company car, while the :guilabel:`Intern` structure type does not. Instead, the
   :guilabel:`Intern` structure type has a meal voucher advantage available, while the
   :guilabel:`Employee` structure type does not.

   A person hired under the :guilabel:`Employee` structure type can use a company car, but cannot
   have meal vouchers. The opposite is true for someone hired under the :guilabel:`Intern` structure
   type. They would have meal vouchers available to them, not the use of a company car.

To make a new benefit, click the :guilabel:`New` button, and enter the information in the fields.
The required fields for a benefit are:

- :guilabel:`Name`: enter the name for the benefit.
- :guilabel:`Related Type`: select from the drop-down menu what type of benefit it is. Select from
  :guilabel:`Monthly Benefit in Kind`, :guilabel:`Monthly Benefits in Net`, :guilabel:`Monthly
  Benefits in Cash`, :guilabel:`Yearly Benefits in Cash`, or :guilabel:`Non Financial Benefits`.
- :guilabel:`Salary Structure Type`: select from the drop-down menu which salary structure type this
  benefit applies to.
- :guilabel:`Display Type`: select from the drop-down menu how this benefit is displayed.

Personal info
-------------

Every employee in Odoo has an *employee card* which is created when a candidate becomes an
employee. This card includes all of their personal information, resume, work information, and
documents.

The personal information is gathered from the salary package configurator section that a
candidate fills out after being offered a position. This personal information is then transferred to
the employee card when they are hired.

To view an employee's card, go to the main :menuselection:`Employees` app dashboard, and click on
the employee's card.

.. note::
   An employee card can be thought of as an employee personnel file.

The *Personal Info* section lists all of the fields that are available to enter on the employee's
card. To access this section, go to :menuselection:`Payroll --> Configuration --> Salary Package
Configurator: Personal Info`.

To edit a personal info entry, select the entry from the list, and modify the personal info. To
create a new personal info entry, click the :guilabel:`New` button.

The required fields, aside from entering the :guilabel:`Information` name, are :guilabel:`Related
Model`, :guilabel:`Related Field`, and :guilabel:`Category`. Select a :guilabel:`Related Model` from
the drop-down menu. :guilabel:`Employee` populates the field by default, but the :guilabel:`Bank
Account` option is also available if the information is related to a bank account instead. Select a
:guilabel:`Related Field` from the drop-down menu that best describes what kind of personal
information this entry is, and where it is going to be stored in the backed. Then, select a
:guilabel:`Category` from the drop-down menu that the personal information should be under, such as
:guilabel:`Address` or :guilabel:`Personal Documents`.

The two most important fields on the personal info form are :guilabel:`Is Required` and
:guilabel:`Display Type`. Checking the :guilabel:`Is Required` box makes the field mandatory on the
employee's card. The :guilabel:`Display Type` drop-down menu allows for the information to be
entered in a variety of ways, from a :guilabel:`Text` box, to a customizable :guilabel:`Radio`
button, a :guilabel:`Checkbox`, a :guilabel:`Document`, and more.

Resume
------

.. note::
   Currently, the :guilabel:`Resume` feature found inside the :menuselection:`Payroll app -->
   Configuration --> Salary Package Configurator: Resume` menu is still in development and only
   serves a specific use case for Belgian markets. The documentation will be updated when this
   section has matured to more markets.

Jobs
====

Since the *Payroll* application is responsible for paying employees for specific job positions, the
complete list of job positions can be found in both the *Payroll* and *Recruitment* applications.

.. _payroll/job-positions:

Job positions
-------------

The job positions listed in the *Payroll* application are identical to the job positions listed in
the *Recruitment* application. If a new job position is added in the *Recruitment* application, it
is also visible in the *Payroll* application, and vice versa. To view the job positions, navigate to
:menuselection:`Payroll app --> Configuration --> Jobs: Job Positions`. A list of all the job
positions appear, along with the corresponding department.

.. image:: payroll/job-positions.png

To create a new job description, click the :guilabel:`New` button and a job form appears. Enter the
information on the form for the new position. The information is identical as to the information
entered when creating a new job position in the *Recruitment* application. Refer to the
:doc:`../hr/recruitment/new_job` document for more details on how to fill out this form.
