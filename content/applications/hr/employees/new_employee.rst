Create a new employee
=====================

When a new employee is hired, the first step is to create a new employee record. Starting in the
:menuselection:`Employees` app dashboard, click the :guilabel:`New` button and a new employee form
appears. Fill out the required information and any additional details.

.. image:: new_employee/new-employee-form.png

   :alt: Create a new employee form with all fields filled out.

.. note::
   The current company phone number and name is populated in the :guilabel:`Work Phone` and
   :guilabel:`Company` fields.

General information
===================

The employee form automatically saves as data is entered, but the save manually icon (a could with
an up arrow inside it) may be clicked at any time to manually save the form.

Required fields
---------------

- :guilabel:`Name`: Enter the employee's name.
- :guilabel:`Company`: Select the company from the drop-down menu that the new employee is hired by,
  or create a new company by typing the name in the field.

.. image:: new_employee/employee-new.png
   :align: center
   :alt: A new employee form with the required fields highlighted.

Optional fields
---------------

- :guilabel:`Photo`: In the top right image box of the employee form, click on the :guilabel:`‚úèÔ∏è
  (pencil)` edit icon to select a photo to upload.
- :guilabel:`Job Position`: Enter the employee's job position title under their name, or select the
  job position from the :guilabel:`Job Position` drop-down menu to have this field auto-populate.
  The :guilabel:`Job Position` field under the employee name can be modified and does not need to
  match the selection made in the :guilabel:`Job Position` drop-down.

  .. example::
     It is recommended to have the job positions match, but if desired, the typed-in description in
     this field can contain more information than the selected drop-down job position.

     An example where this may be applicable is if someone is hired for a sales representative
     position configured as :guilabel:`Sales Representative` in the *Recruitment* app, and that is
     selected for the drop-down :guilabel:`Job Position` field.

     In the typed in job position field beneath the employee's name, the position could be more
     specific, such as `Sales Representative - Subscriptions` if the employee is focused solely on
     subscription sales.

     .. image:: new_employee/job-description-fields.png
        :align: center
        :alt: Both job position fields entered but with different information.

- Tags: Click on a tag in the drop-down menu to add any tags applicable to the employee. Any tag can
  be created in this field by typing it in. Once created, the new tag is available for all employee
  records. There is no limit to the amount of tags that can be added.
- Work Contact Information: Enter the employee's :guilabel:`Work Mobile`, :guilabel:`Work Phone`,
  :guilabel:`Work Email`, and/or :guilabel:`Company` name.
- :guilabel:`Department`: Select the employee's department from the drop-down menu.
- :guilabel:`Job Position`: Select the employee's job position from the drop-down menu. Once a
  selection is made, the :guilabel:`Job Position` field beneath the employee's name automatically
  updates to reflect the currently selected job position. These positions are from the
  :doc:`Recruitment <../../hr/recruitment/new_job/>` application, and reflect the currently \
  configured job positions.
- :guilabel:`Manager`: Select the employee's manager from the drop-down menu.
- :guilabel:`Coach`: Select the employee's coach from the drop-down menu.
- :guilabel:`Next Appraisal Date`: This date automatically populates with a date that is computed
  according to the settings configured in the *Appraisals* application. This date can be modified
  using the calendar selector.

.. note::
   After a :guilabel:`Manager` is selected, if the :guilabel:`Coach` field is blank, the selected
   manager automatically populates the :guilabel:`Coach` field.

.. tip::
   To make edits to the selected :guilabel:`Department`, :guilabel:`Manager`, :guilabel:`Coach`, or
   :guilabel:`Company`, click the :guilabel:`Internal Link` arrow next to the respective selection.
   The :guilabel:`Internal Link` arrow opens the selected form, allowing for modifications. Click
   :guilabel:`Save` after any edits are made.

The Work Information tab is where the employee's specific job related information is housed. Their
working schedule, various roles, who approves their specific requests (time off, timesheets, and
expenses), and specific work location details are listed here. Click on the :guilabel:`Work
Information` tab to access this section, and enter the following information for the new employee.

- :guilabel:`Location`: Select the :guilabel:`Work Address` from the drop-down menu. To modify the
  address, hover over the first line (if there are multiple lines) of the address to reveal an
  :guilabel:`Internal Link` arrow. Click the :guilabel:`Internal Link` arrow to open up the company
  form, and make any edits. Use the breadcrumb menu to navigate back to the new employee form when
  done. If a new work address is needed, add the address by typing it in the field, then click
  :guilabel:`Create (new address)` to add the address, or :guilabel:`Create and edit...` to add the
  new address and edit the address form.
- :guilabel:`Approvers`: In order to see this section, the user must have either
  :guilabel:`Administrator` or :guilabel:`Officer: Manage all employees` rights set for the
  :guilabel:`Employees` application. Using the drop-down menus, select the users responsible for
  approving :guilabel:`Expenses`, :guilabel:`Time Off`, and :guilabel:`Timesheets` for the employee.
  Hover over any of the selections to reveal the :guilabel:`Internal Link` arrow. Click the

  :guilabel:`Email Address`, :guilabel:`Company`, :guilabel:`Phone`, :guilabel:`Mobile`, and

  work from, for each day of the week. The default options are :guilabel:`Home`, :guilabel:`Office`,
  or :guilabel:`Other`. A new location can be typed into the field, then click either
  :guilabel:`Create (new location)` to add the location, or :guilabel:`Create and edit...` to add
  the new location and edit the form. After edits are done, click :guilabel:`Save & Close`, and the
  new location is added, and populates the field. For days the employee does not work, for example,
  Saturday and Sunday, leave the field blank (:guilabel:`Unspecified`).

  .. note::
     It is also possible to add or modify work locations by navigating to :menuselection:`Employees
     app --> Configuration --> Employee: Work Locations`. Click :guilabel:`New` to create a new
     location, then enter the details on the form. To modify a location, click on an existing
     location, then make any changes on the form.

- :guilabel:`Schedule`: Select the :guilabel:`Working Hours` and :guilabel:`Timezone` for the
  employee. The :guilabel:`Internal Link` arrow opens up a detailed view of the specific daily
  working hours. Working hours can be modified or deleted here.

  .. note::
     Working hours can also be modified in the *Payroll* application, where they are referred to as
     :guilabel:`Working Schedules`. For more information on how to create or modify
     :guilabel:`Working Schedules` in Payroll, refer to the :doc:`../../hr/payroll` documentation.

- :guilabel:`Planning`: Click on a role from the drop-down menu for both the :guilabel:`Roles` and
  the :guilabel:`Default Role` fields to add a role. There is no limit to the amount of
  :guilabel:`Roles` that can be selected for an employee, but there can only be one
  :guilabel:`Default Role`. The default role is the *typical* role that the employee performs, where
  the :guilabel:`Roles` are *all* the specific roles the employee is able to perform. The
  :guilabel:`Default Role` must be selected as a :guilabel:`Role`, if not, when the
  :guilabel:`Default Role` is selected, that role is automatically added to the list of
  :guilabel:`Roles`.

.. tip::
   The :guilabel:`Planning` section affects the *Planning* app, and will only appear if the
   *Planning* app is installed. When planning work in the *Planning* app, employees can only be
   scheduled for specific work that corresponds to their selected roles. For example, only an
   employee with a *Functional Tester* role can be assigned to perform any activity that requires a
   *Functional Tester*.

.. important::
   The users that appear in the drop-down menu for the :guilabel:`Approvers` section must have
   *Administrator* rights set for the corresponding human resources role. To check who has these
   rights, go to :menuselection:`Settings app --> Users --> ‚Üí Manage Users`. Click on an employee,
   and check the :guilabel:`Human Resources` section of the :guilabel:`Access Rights` tab.

   - In order for the user to appear as an approver for :guilabel:`Expenses`, they must have either
     :guilabel:`Team Approver`, :guilabel:`All Approver`, or :guilabel:`Administrator` set for the
     :guilabel:`Expenses` role.

     :guilabel:`Officer` or :guilabel:`Administrator` set for the :guilabel:`Time Off` role.

     either :guilabel:`Manager`, :guilabel:`Officer`, or :guilabel:`Administrator` set for the
     :guilabel:`Payroll` role.

.. note::
   :guilabel:`Working Hours` are related to a company's working times, and an employee cannot have
   working hours that are outside of a company's working times.

   Each individual working time is company-specific, so for multi-company databases, each company
   needs to have its own working hours set.

   If an employee's working hours are not configured as a working time for the company, new working
   times can be added, or existing working times can be modified. To add or modify a working time,
   go to the :menuselection:`Payroll app --> Configuration --> Working Times`, and add a new working
   time or edit an existing one.

   After the new working time is created, or an existing one is modified, select the employee's
   working hours using the drop-down menu in the :guilabel:`Schedule` section of the
   :guilabel:`Work Information` tab.

  of Dependent Children` in the field.
- :guilabel:`Emergency`: Type in the :guilabel:`Contact Name` and :guilabel:`Contact Phone` number
  of the employee's emergency contact in the respective fields.
- :guilabel:`Citizenship`: This section contains all the information relevant to the citizenship of
  the employee. Some fields use a drop-down menu, as the :guilabel:`Nationality (Country)`,
  :guilabel:`Gender`, and :guilabel:`Country of Birth` fields do. The :guilabel:`Date of Birth` uses
  a calendar selector to select the date. First, click on the name of the month, then the year, to
  access the year ranges. Use the :guilabel:`< (left)` and :guilabel:`> (right)` arrow icons,
  navigate to the correct year range, and click on the year. Next, click on the month. Last, click
